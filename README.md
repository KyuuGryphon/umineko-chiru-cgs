# Umineko When They Cry Chiru - CG Restoration Mod
A patch for the 2017 Mangagamer release of Umineko Chiru, to restore the unused Pachinko CGs to the game.
----
## About
The Mangagamer release of **Umineko no Naku Koro ni Chiru** (available through both their website and via Steam) has, like their initial release of **Umineko no Naku Koro ni** itself, a number of unused CG images present in the game's files. However, _unlike_ their release of Umineko, none of the CGs are called or even defined in Chiru's script. Whether this was due to technical constraints or some other reason is unknown.

This patch aims to restore these CGs to the game, in a manner that avoids any unwanted behaviour if the player switches between the original PC sprites and the new Pachinko sprites. A few typos and inconsistencies in the script are also fixed.
## Feedback
This patch is in its very early stages at the moment. Other than bug reports, constructive feedback on CG locations, script errors that could use correcting, and script changes that are unnecessary is welcome. Please read the [Feedback Notes](https://github.com/KyuuGryphon/umineko-chiru-cgs/issues/1) thread before creating a new issue.
## Installation
(todo: this, once the next release is done)
## Future Plans
# For this patch
Once I reach Episode 8, I want to look into acquiring/recreating two scenes that are present in [the artbook for the Pachinko version of the game, Character of the Slot Golden Witch](https://www.ninoma.com/index.php/character-of-the-slot-golden-witch-umineko-no-naku-koro-ni-artbooks), that are not present in Chiru's archives. Implementing these once the files are acquired will be simple, it's the acquisition that may be difficult.
# Other plans
Once this Chiru patch is complete, I plan on making a version of it that is compatible with 07th Modding's [Chiru voice patch](https://github.com/07th-mod/umineko-answer/tree/master/voices-only). After that, I may look at making a similar patch for Umineko (while its CGs are defined, the calls are somewhat buggy and some of them are still unimplemented)
